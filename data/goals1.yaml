  Food Processing Focus (DW/RATs)
  RIG/FRM/FP = 7/7/8
  primary is FP -> RAT/DW
  secondary is surplus RIG -> H20
  tertiary is surplus FRM -> GRN/BEA/VEG
goals: 
  - description: step 1b (6-4-3 ensure ample water supplies)
    notes: |
      water supply is short... 
      add rigs to stay ahead on foundational mats

future-goals: 
  notes: |
    Build out Promitor into an FP focus to generate cash flow
    Figure out where to expand next and what to provide
      - LST (limestone)
      - A colony where PTU is trying to gain influence
    Other ideas...
    Investigating setup needed for CAF / COF production
    NS Nutrient Solution production
    CAF Caffeinated Beans production
    COF Caffeinated Infusion production
    CHP (Chemical Plant) to enable NS production
    HYF (Hydroponics Farm) to enable CAF production
    FP (Additional Food Processor) to enable COF production
