- Analyze needs for current goal
    - Building materials needed
    - Building materials costs
    - Worker impacts - available hab vs. required prod
    - Space impacts
- Set input files in a single config file
- Calculation and addition of manufacturing fees
- Add building condition to line efficiency - 
    - dropped 100.0% to 99.9% after period 1 (1 week)
    - dropped 99.9% to 99.8% after period 2
- Addition of building depreciation... 
    - dropped 1/26 of value after period 1 (1 week?)
    - appears to depreciate over a 26 week period 
- Log key metrics from runs to a single location
    - format should allow for easy comparison of key metrics between runs
    - identify source value stream, inventory, market files
- Log run details to run-specific logging instead of using stdout and routing to file
    - per production line files
    - single overall run file
    - probably in new sub directory
- Handle multiple sites in extract building data 
    - generated building config is only accurate for single sites
    - different sites will have different material costs and possibly availability
- Add Income Statement - overall  
- Add Income Statement - for each production line
- Daily Reporting - resource consumption/production
- Auto-generate value streams based on inputs/outputs
- Acquire resources from the market
- Sell resources to the market
- Worker efficiency edge cases (running below 100% of required essential supply)
- model worker barracks and pool of available workers
