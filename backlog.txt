- Log efficiency to ledger
- Add production line efficiency to output report
- Shared queue between buildings of the same type (actual game function)
    - as opposed to current impl - separate queues for each building
- Calculation and addition of manufacturing fees
- Add building condition to line efficiency - 
    - dropped 100.0% to 99.9% after period 1 (1 week?)
- Addition of building depreciation... 
    - dropped 1/26 of value after period 1 (1 week?)
    - appears to depreciate over a 26 week period 
- Log key metrics from runs to a single location
    - format should allow for easy comparison of key metrics between runs
    - identify source value stream, inventory, market files
- Log run details to run-specific logging instead of using stdout and routing to file
    - per production line files
    - single overall run file
    - probably in new sub directory
- Daily Reporting - resource consumption/production
- Autogenerate value streams based on inputs/outputs
- Acquire resources from the market
- Worker efficiency edge cases (running below 100% of required essential supply)
- model worker barracks and pool of available workers
- change building spec to handle multiple types of workers
